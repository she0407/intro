        <p>about myself </p>
        <p>With a strong foundation in computer engineering and a diverse skill set, I'm on a journey to excel in cloud computing.

            My academic journey began at Gandhinagar University in India, where I earned my bachelor's degree in computer engineering. During my college years, I honed my programming skills and served as the head of the entrepreneurship cell, where I learned valuable lessons.
            
            After graduation, I pursued further education in cloud computing at Conestoga College in Ontario, Canada. I'm actively working towards becoming a proficient cloud architect/administrator, acquiring the skills and expertise needed to excel in this dynamic field.
            
            Beyond my technical pursuits, I find joy in creative activities. I dabble in art, work with Revit for 2D and 3D architecture, and savor the delights of cooking, writing, and reading. These pursuits enrich my life and offer unique perspectives that I bring to my work in the tech industry.
